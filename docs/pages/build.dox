\page build_gwork Building Gwork

\section Introduction

Gwork is divided into layers (see [source][source]):

- `platform` - Provides a common API to the supported platform.
- `gwork` - The GUI API, which contains no target specific code.
- `samples`/`test` - Some examples for demonstration and testing.

The project creates libraries for *platform* and *gwork*, which you can then link to
your project. You can see an example of how to do this in the samples. There is one for
each of the targets supported. [Cmake][cmake] is used to generate project files for 
your chosen build environment.

There are two ways in which you can use the project file generation:

- Generate entire project in cmake. You could then have Gwork as a sub-project.
- Generate build files, build, and install. You use cmake to build your project,
  then install the project to a standard location and use it as a regular library.

\section using_cmake Using Cmake

If you are not familiar with cmake:

- [Cmake overview](https://cmake.org/overview/) - What cmake is and why it was created.
- [Cmake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) - Quick introduction on how to use it.

Some useful links for using Cmake: 

- [Cmake download](https://cmake.org/download/) - How to get it.
- [Cmake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) - Documentation on the current version.
- [Cmake wiki](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake) - Lots of miscellaneous details.

It is best to build the project in subdirectory of the main project, e.g. in a directory
called "build". You might make multiple versions of the project for different options 
or targets this way (e.g. "build_sdl2", "build_allegro5", etc).

\subsection win_build Windows

\code{.sh}
cmake --help    # show cmake options
\endcode

\note Currently Windows only supports cross platform targets, i.e. the ones listed below.

To generate project files:

\code{.sh}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DRENDER_ALLEGRO5=ON ..
start gwork.sln
\endcode

\subsection osx_build OSX

\code{.sh}
cmake -h    # show cmake options
\endcode

To generate project files:

\code{.sh}
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Xcode -DRENDER_ALLEGRO5=ON ..
open gwork.xcodeproj
\endcode

\subsection linux_build Linux

\code{.sh}
cmake -h    # show cmake options
\endcode

To generate project files:

\code{.sh}
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DRENDER_ALLEGRO5=ON ..
\endcode

\section gwork_targets Targets

Gwork currently supports the following rendering targets. You can choose these by 
defining a variable when you run cmake to generate the project files,
i.e. `-DRENDER_<TARGET>=ON`, e.g. :-

- Allegro 5: `-DRENDER_ALLEGRO5=ON`
- OpenGL: `-DRENDER_OPENGL=ON`
- SDL2: `-DRENDER_SDL2=ON`
- SFML2: `-DRENDER_SFML2=ON`
- Null (used for testing): `-DRENDER_NULL=ON`

\note You can only choose one target at a time. If you would like to compile multiple targets,
create multiple build folders and create different project files and targets in each.

Some tests and a sample are included for each target by default. These can be turned off using:

- `-DBUILD_TEST=OFF`
- `-DBUILD_SAMPLE=OFF`

You should compile and run the sample before using Gwork in your own project to make sure that
everything is working correctly.

The *null* render target is used for testing. It does not compile or link against any
target API, hence "null". It can be used to generate the Gwork memory usage stats. If you 
are having problems compiling your project against your chosen target you could try compiling
against null to see if the problem is related to Gwork or the target API.

\subsection target_notes Notes on the Targets

- SDL2
  - SDL2 has a clipping bug in versions before 2.0.5. This results in most things not appearing
    on the screen. See the issue for screenshots and 
    [more details](https://github.com/billyquith/GWork/issues/18).
- SFML2
  - When creating an SFML2 project make sure you include the "window" component as this is
    what pulls in the OpenGL dependencies:
    `find_package(SFML 2 COMPONENTS system window graphics REQUIRED)`.

\section gwork_cmake_embed Using Gwork in your project

An example cmake project is supplied below.

\code{.cmake}
# CMake build instructions for app embedding Gwork 

# configure cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0004 OLD)

# we require C++11 - this set appropriate flags for compilers, which may not be portable
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

project(AppUsingGwork)

# Gwork is sub-project of this one
set(GWORK_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/gwork)
add_subdirectory(${GWORK_DIR})

# GUI lib, change to suit. Borrow Gwork modules.
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${GWORK_DIR}/cmake/Modules/")
find_package(Allegro5 REQUIRED)

include_directories(${GWORK_DIR}/source/platform/include
                    ${GWORK_DIR}/source/gwork/include
                    ${GWORK_DIR}/source/test/include
                    ${ALLEGRO5_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(AppUsingGwork Allegro5Sample.cpp)

target_link_libraries(AppUsingGwork Gwork GworkAllegro5 GworkTest ${ALLEGRO5_LIBRARIES})

\endcode

This assumes that you have the directory structure:

- Project/
    - CMakeLists.txt  (above config)
    - Gwork/

\note When you run cmake you still need to use the above cmake command-line arguments to generate the project. Gwork needs to know which renderer etc you want to use.
